# The Great Suggestor

> This repository contains details about the Great Suggestor Model that we are building. 
> ## AIM
> The model essentially gives startsup suggestions to interested VCs and relevant investors to searching startups.
> ## Process Flow
> <br> Our vision is to create a model that will enable investors and/or startups to upload information about them. Our machine learning model will parse it, understand the key terms defining them.
Bassed on that it will then suggest them relevant parties. In other words, for startups it will suggest relevant investors who are likely to invest whereas for optimistics VCs, it will suggest startups
it will suggest startups aligned with their area of interest. So far, we have designed a website that registers and logs in investors and startups. It asks them to either upload their website URL or a PDF
document having details about business. Our deep learning models understands this and predicts relevant investors profiles and also related startups for the VCs interested to invest. We are currently working to enahnce our model performance and also provide more services to them.

? ## WIP
This week contains information about the WIP and every week's contribution towards it.
### Week 4-5 (19th April - 24th April)
 This week we worked towards enhancing our model results and how to add more functionalities in the current website. We worked on  web scraping to gather maximum information about the clients profile
(whether a VC or startup, important infromation from its website) and alsom gather information about all the investors present on internet. We also had a demo of our working model.
